Snake game
V1.0
This is my attempt at making a browser based snake game as a way to pratice using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
The current features are:
- Score tracker
- Random starting position for snake
- Random spawning of food (in spaces not occupied by snake)

There is currently a bug where if you, while going up, hit right and down in quick succession the snake ends up eating itself
