Snake game <br />
V1.1<br />
- Added a stopwatch on the right 
- Added a leaderboard that takes note of your fastest and most recent time to get 500 points
V1.0 <br />
This is my attempt at making a browser based snake game as a way to pratice using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
The current features are:
- Score tracker
- Random starting position for snake
- Random spawning of food (in spaces not occupied by snake)

There is currently a bug where if you, while going up, hit right and down in quick succession the snake ends up eating itself
